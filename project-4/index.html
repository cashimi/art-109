    <h1>Project 4 Mini Essay: Internet of the Future</h1>
    <pre>
        In 50-100 years from now, the Internet will no longer feel like a separate place from the physical world: it will be the world. Even today in 2025, people use the Internet as a place of escapism, while others perform their daily work and tasks on it. But as our presence online grows, so does the Internet’s influence on how we live, learn, socialize, and survive.

        In 50-100 years from now, a young teenager might open her new MacBook Pro, equipped with the highest internal specs for peak performance. They will be greeted with an interface that feels more alive than mechanical. The moment they log on, the device syncs with her neural profile, adjusting brightness, voice feedback, and layout to match their mental state. They slip instantly into the boundless online worlds that make up their everyday life. This device now acts as their physical best friend; they are inseparable from one another and are always seen together. 
        
        Because access to the Internet has only broadened, they experience unsolicited access to the Internet, but on an exponentially larger scale; parents will still attempt to set restrictions and fail every time as teenagers find different ways to be sneaky. Their “friend list” stretches across thousands of profiles, some identities blurred being uncertain of who is real and who is not. AI chatbots have been training for years, making them so advanced they can imitate human speech patterns, emotional quirks, and long-term memories. Agentic AI has allowed them to roam freely on social platforms and most places on the Internet. The teenager could easily confide in someone they believe to be their best friend, unaware that the said “friend” is a machine trained on previous data of different human interactions.
        
        Taking a peek outside the window, the world is less comfortable than the one many knew. Decades of environmental strain from data storage demands, energy consumption, and climate instability have made outdoor life harsh in many regions. While it is still breathable and liveable to go out and perform different activities, officials recommend staying indoors until they find a way to bring clean air and life back. This era almost imitates the global COVID pandemic as many are cooped in their homes while other “careless” individuals continue regular life. Those that comply not only do it for their safety, but because life online is more stable and predictable. In many ways, life on the Internet is more fulfilling.
        
        Online spaces are not just social hubs as they have become centers of activism. Users compose immersive spaces where websites function as interactive ecosystems for global concerns. In these spaces, people gather to solve problems collaboratively, visually simulating the outcomes of policy changes or corporate actions. Companies join not out of the good of their hearts, but because participating earns them digital credibility points, which directly affects their consumer base and algorithmic ranking. Though sounding unethical, this helps activists to be heard more than if they were to do it on the streets. Having centers of activisms in our physical world can be limiting as the information only reaches a certain region. However since many have fully migrated to the Internet lifestyle, users are more likely to be exposed to said concerns they are trying to change.
        
        In 50-100 years from now, work, too, will have fully migrated online. After the pandemic in the 2020s, companies attempted implementing hybrid model workflows. This method worked for some time, but it became clear that almost all knowledge work could be completed with a laptop and Internet connection. Offices became obsolete relics of a slower era. Even big name companies have empty buildings, giving them an abandoned feel when passing by. Now, employees attend meetings through ultra high definition Zoom spheres, participate in conferences hosted in immersive VR auditoriums, and even join team-building events in gamified environments powered with AR. This is impactful as all of this can be done in the comfort of their own home.
        
        At first, the idea of doing everything online felt isolating and almost dystopian due to lack of real human interaction. Though over time, workers adjusted and even embraced it. By living on the Internet, they have gained time: time to explore interests, adopt hobbies, and even build fully virtual second lives. Their work windows existed beside tabs for gardening simulators, AI-generated fitness mentors, and collaborative creative forms. Workers harness many monitors at once, constantly staying stimulated without being given a chance to breathe or take in what is actually going on around them. Though, life became more controllable and customizable this way, and many workers preferred it.
        
        Still, the Internet of 50-100 years in the future remains a living organism: messy, sprawling, vibrant, and deeply human, even as the line between human and machine becomes extremely blurry. It reflects not just technological progress, but our collective desire to stay connected, to find meaning, and to build worlds. Real or virtual, we all just want that feeling and sense of home.
